# Demo Flow – ADVYO

This document summarizes the complete workflow demonstrated through the delivered screen recordings and artifacts.

---

## 🔹 Phase 1 – Manual Development (Recorded)

- Initial coding executed in VS Code **before** installing Q Developer  
- Static HTML pages created from scratch (homepage, login, FAQ)  
- Layout, inline CSS, and inline JS built manually  
- Full screen recording available in `/assets/recordings/`

---

## 🔹 Phase 2 – Q Developer Enhancement

- Q Developer activated to refine UI and reorganize structure  
- Cleaned HTML, improved layouts, and accelerated component creation  
- Eliminated repetitive edits and improved efficiency  
- Demonstrates the required “manual → Q-assisted improvement” workflow

---

## 🔹 Phase 3 – Deployment on AWS

- Final files placed inside `/var/www/html/` on an EC2 instance  
- Nginx served the pages immediately without additional configuration  
- Testing performed in a live environment using EC2 public URL  
- Ensures a production-grade demo path for judges

---

## 🔹 Phase 4 – Repository Curation

- Static HTML exported from EC2 into `/src/`  
- Screenshots and demo clips organized under `/assets/`  
- Documentation stored in `/docs/` for structured review  
- No backend code included; this repository is frontend-focused and safe for public submission

---

## 🔹 Demo Deliverables

- Fully working public UI hosted on AWS  
- Verified manual + Q Developer workflow recordings  
- Clean, judge-ready GitHub repository  
- Clear evidence of AWS usage and Q-accelerated development
