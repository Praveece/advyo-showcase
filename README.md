# Advyo — Q Developer Frontend Showcase

Advyo is an AI-first supply-chain assistant.  
This repository showcases the **public static pages** (homepage, login, FAQ) that were manually built and later refined using **Amazon Q Developer**.  
Backend logic and authenticated dashboards remain private; only safe screenshots and documentation are provided for judge review.
