# Advyo — Q Developer Frontend Showcase

Short: Advyo is an AI-first supply-chain assistant. This public repo showcases the frontend pages (homepage, login, FAQ) generated and refined with Amazon Q Developer. Backend logic is private; a sanitized demo and screenshots are provided for judges.

## What this repo contains
- `src/` — public pages (homepage, login, FAQ)
- `assets/` — screenshots + short demo clip
- `demo/` — minimal runnable snippet (safe)
- `aws-usage.md` — explicit description of AWS services used
- `demo-instructions.md` — how to run the frontend locally and test

## How to run (local)
1. `npm install` (if project uses a package.json)
2. `npm run dev` or `npx http-server ./src` (if static)
3. Open `http://localhost:3000` or the port shown.

## Deploy
This repo is intended for quick deployment to GitHub Pages or Vercel for hackathon judges.
