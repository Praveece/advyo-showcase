# AWS Usage — Advyo

- **Amazon Q Developer:** used as the agent development environment (in VS Code) for generating agent code, iterating prompts and actions, and testing agent decision flows locally.
- **Amazon EC2:** hosts the Advyo backend during testing; runs worker scripts and exposes a simple API endpoint for the demo.
- **Optional (if used):** S3 for storing artifacts, CloudWatch for logs/metrics.

Proof: demo video + screenshots in /assets show VS Code pre-Q Developer edits and EC2 console showing the instance and app logs.
