# AWS Usage — Advyo

This project was developed and refined entirely on an AWS EC2 instance.

## EC2
- Ubuntu EC2 instance was used as the development environment.
- All project files were created and edited inside `/var/www/html/advyo/`.
- VS Code Remote SSH was used to connect and develop directly on the EC2 machine.

## Nginx
- Nginx served the frontend pages on EC2.
- This allowed real-time preview while building and refining the UI.

## Why this matters
The hackathon requires real AWS usage.  
This project satisfies the requirement through:
- Active development on EC2  
- Live preview via Nginx  
- Remote workflow validated through screenshots in the `assets/` folder
