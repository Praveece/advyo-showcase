# AWS Usage — Advyo

- **Amazon Q Developer**
  - Used inside VS Code to generate, iterate and refine frontend pages and agent prompts.
  - Helped accelerate UI scaffolding (homepage, login, FAQ) and produce consistent UX components.

- **Amazon EC2**
  - Hosted the Advyo backend test instance (private); used for staging API endpoints and worker scripts.
  - EC2 console screenshots (in /assets) show instance and basic app logs used for verification.

- **Optional (if applicable)**
  - **S3**: static assets and screenshots storage for demo.
  - **CloudWatch**: logging and basic metrics for worker scripts.

Proof: demo video and screenshots in `/assets` show VS Code (pre-Q Developer), the Q Developer output, and EC2 console.
