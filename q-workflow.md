# Q Developer Workflow — Advyo

## Manual Phase
The homepage, login, and FAQ pages were first created manually.  
A screen recording in the `assets/` folder shows VS Code editing before Q Developer was installed.

## Q Developer Phase
After installing Amazon Q Developer:
- Code cleanup suggestions were applied.
- UI layout improvements were generated.
- Repeated elements were modularized.
- Styling fixes and structural refinements were accepted.

## Evidence
The `assets/` folder contains:
- Before/after code screenshots
- Recording of manual coding
- Screenshots of Q Developer suggestions

## Why this matters
This demonstrates actual productivity improvement from manual → AI-assisted development, which the hackathon requires.
