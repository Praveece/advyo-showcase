# Demo Instructions (Advyo Q Frontend)

## Local (static)
1. Serve `src/` folder with a static server:
   - `npx http-server ./src -p 8080`
2. Open `http://localhost:8080`

## If using Node/Vite/Next
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
3. Open the URL printed by the dev server.

## What to test
- Homepage navigation
- Login flow (UI only; no backend auth required)
- FAQ page content and links

## Note
Backend business logic is private. This frontend demonstrates the UI surface generated/refined with Amazon Q Developer and the UX flow that interacts with backend endpoints (stubs).
